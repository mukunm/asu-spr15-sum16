====================
Readme - Project - 1
====================

=================
1 - Crawl
=================

In order to run, do the following
 - Run the crawl.sh file on a linux environment with Python 2.9 and Scrapy 0.24.6 installed
 - Ensure that the folder structure is intact. The script assumes a few relative paths for a successful run.
 
The outputs generated here will be a few .csv files.

On obtaining these csv files ensure that the 2 additional scripts are run in the order that they are numbered and have
all the outputs previously generated in the same folder.

Sample outputs are present in this package.

==============================
2 - Analysis and Modelling
==============================

There is only one script which performs all the remaining parts of the project.
Ensure that the anonymized_edge_list.csv is placed in this folder before this script is run.
