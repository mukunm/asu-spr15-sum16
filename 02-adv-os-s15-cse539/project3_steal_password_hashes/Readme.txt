The aim of the project was to find passwords given a few stolen hashes
and the fact that the hashes were obtained using MD5 algorithm.

The aim had to be achieved through 2 methods
1. BruteForce
2. Rainbow Table

The passwords were restricted to contain only characters and numbers
[a-z][A-Z][0-9]
The passwords were of 4 bytes in length
Hashes were also of 4 bytes in length.

=================
Results
=================
Brute force algorithm was able to obtain all passwords
Rainbow Table algorithm was able to obtain 6 passwords out of the 10 hashes
that were stolen. The algorithm developed and details of the result are available 
in the report.
