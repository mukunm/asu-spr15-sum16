The aim of the project was to 
1. Analyse and find weaknesses in the given encryption algorithm.
2. Use the weaknesses to brute force the encrypted PNG, PDF and TXT files 

=============
Results 
=============
PNG and PDF files were brute forced successfuly. TXT file was taking too much time
brute force. Details of the analysis of the algorithm are available in the report.

Note: In order to brute force different files present in the ip_op_files folder, 
      copy them to the place where the executable of the program is built and rename it
      to output. Also use the makefile to build the program in the required mode as
      per the file chosen.
