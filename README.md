All projects carried out during my Master's degree in Computer Science at Arizona State University from Jan 2015 - July 2016.

The following is the ordered from what I think is the most exciting to least.

## 02 - Advanced Operating Systems
> This was my most loved project. I wrote a wonderful abstraction layer by building a byte structure that would represent a file system in-memory somewhat mimicking a RAMDisk for files of size 512 bytes. 
> 
> The best part of this project was that, I was able to use this file system as a lower layer for a later project during my Master's degree which is 07 on the list of my projects.

## 01 - Advanced Cryptography
> Some parts of this course were awesome. Basically, I was coming up with new algorithms to encrypt and decrypt, writing C programs to do the byte manipulation that would implement the theory. 
> 
> More challenging things were implementing the rainbow table, so on and so forth which was also a lot of fun.

## 07 - Advanced Databases
> We basically built different types of indexes and tested their performance on Memory.
> 
> In order to test the performance in memory, I used parts of my project from Advanced Operating systems to store data on memory instead of storing them on the disk. The algorithms for Database indexes were written in Java, but memory allocation was all done in C and the C library was dynamically linked to the Java process.

## 06 - Statistical Machine Learning
> This was the most organized project group, I've ever had in academia. We used a Yelp Dataset to build a restaurant recommender system. Although, I only made theoretical contributions, this project taught me a fair bit about machine learning approaches and helped us realize a lot of the things we wanted to get, as a group especially because we set expectations at the start.

## 04 - Multimedia Processing Techniques
> I got a lot of learning on OpenCV and python in this project. The start to this course was good. But, as things went on, expectations were too high and our project group couldn't sustain the pressure and fell short towards the end.
> But, things like frame matching, quantization of video components and more such multimedia processing using OpenCV was done.

## 03 - Distributed Software Development
> This was a simple project: REST APIs, C# ASP .Net. Was light and fun. Learning a new Language was definitely fun.

## 05 - Social Media Mining
> This course could either be good or bad depending on which social network you were going to crawl and scrape. Since only 2 groups could take up the same site, I was left with a website called Twoo which was really hard to crawl and get any useful data.
> 
> Although, I found some ways to crawl, I couldn't do very well with that data towards the latter stages of the course. This was one course which I wanted to do well in, but couldn't do much becuase of the ridiculous restriction.
